# Eco-Conscious Web Application: Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development plan for the **Eco-Conscious Web Application for Recycling Spot Discovery, Waste Reporting, and Environmental Monitoring**. The project is divided into phases, with each phase focusing on specific features and milestones.

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Planning
- **Milestone 1.1**: Define project scope and requirements.
  - Finalize features: Recycling spot discovery, pollution information dashboard, waste reporting, and user authentication.
  - Create wireframes and mockups for the web application.
- **Milestone 1.2**: Set up the development environment.
  - Choose a tech stack (e.g., React.js for frontend, Node.js/Express for backend, PostgreSQL/MongoDB for database).
  - Initialize the GitHub repository and set up version control.
  - Create a basic project structure.

---

## Phase 2: Core Features Development
### Recycling Spot Discovery
- **Milestone 2.1**: Implement a map interface for recycling spot discovery.
  - Integrate a map API (e.g., Google Maps, Mapbox).
  - Add markers for recycling points with relevant details (e.g., address, type of materials accepted).
- **Milestone 2.2**: Enable search and filtering functionality.
  - Allow users to search for recycling points by location or material type.
  - Add filters for accessibility (e.g., reachable by vehicle).

### Pollution Information Dashboard
- **Milestone 2.3**: Integrate APIs for environmental data.
  - Fetch air quality and water quality data from public APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, AQICN).
  - Display data in a user-friendly dashboard with charts and indicators.
- **Milestone 2.4**: Add water drinkability information.
  - Include a feature to indicate whether water in a specific area is drinkable.

### Waste Reporting System
- **Milestone 2.5**: Create a waste reporting form.
  - Allow users to report areas affected by debris.
  - Include fields for details (e.g., location, type of waste, accessibility by vehicle).
- **Milestone 2.6**: Implement backend functionality for waste reports.
  - Store reports in the database and allow local authorities to access them.

---

## Phase 3: User Authentication and Authorization
- **Milestone 3.1**: Implement user accounts.
  - Allow users to create accounts and log in.
  - Include guest login functionality for users who donâ€™t want to create accounts.
- **Milestone 3.2**: Add role-based access control.
  - Differentiate between regular users and local authorities (e.g., authorities can view and manage waste reports).

---

## Phase 4: Testing and Optimization
- **Milestone 4.1**: Conduct unit and integration testing.
  - Test individual components and features for functionality and performance.
- **Milestone 4.2**: Optimize the application.
  - Improve load times and responsiveness.
  - Ensure compatibility across different devices and browsers.

---

## Phase 5: Documentation and Finalization
- **Milestone 5.1**: Write comprehensive documentation.
  - Include a user guide and developer documentation.
  - Document the API endpoints and database schema.
- **Milestone 5.2**: Prepare for submission.
  - Finalize the thesis report.
  - Create a presentation for the thesis defense.

---

## Phase 6: Deployment and Maintenance
- **Milestone 6.1**: Deploy the web application.
  - Host the application on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Vercel).
  - Set up a custom domain if necessary.
- **Milestone 6.2**: Plan for future updates.
  - Gather user feedback and identify areas for improvement.
  - Add new features or expand functionality based on user needs.
