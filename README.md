# Roadmap: Eco-Conscious Web Application for Recycling Spot Discovery, Waste Reporting, and Environmental Monitoring
## Phase 1: Core Features Development
### 1.1 Recycling Point Discovery
- [ ] Design and implement a map-based interface for discovering nearby recycling points.
- [ ] Integrate a database of recycling locations with categories for different waste types.
- [ ] Add search and filtering functionality for recycling points.

### 1.2 Environmental Monitoring Dashboard
- [ ] Develop a dashboard displaying:
  - Air quality data (e.g., AQI, pollutants).
  - Water quality information (e.g., pH levels, contaminants).
  - Drinkable water availability status.
- [ ] Integrate APIs for real-time environmental data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, AirVisual).
- [ ] Add data visualization (charts, graphs) for easy interpretation.

### 1.3 Waste Reporting Page
- [ ] Create a form-based interface for users to report areas affected by debris.
- [ ] Include fields for:
  - Location (map pin or address input).
  - Description of the issue.
  - Accessibility details (e.g., reachable by vehicle).
- [ ] Implement a notification system for local authorities or relevant stakeholders.

## Phase 2: User Account Management
- [ ] Develop a user authentication system:
  - Account creation with email/password.
  - Guest login functionality.
- [ ] Implement a profile page for registered users to view their submitted reports.
- [ ] Add optional preferences for notifications or data display settings.

## Phase 3: Enhancements and Optimization
- [ ] Optimize web app performance and scalability.
- [ ] Add mobile responsiveness for a seamless experience across devices.
- [ ] Implement localization support (e.g., multiple languages).

## Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
- [ ] Fix bugs and refine user interface.

## Phase 5: Future Features
- [ ] Add gamification elements to encourage eco-friendly behaviors (e.g., badges for recycling contributions).
- [ ] Enable real-time collaboration between users and authorities for waste cleanup drives.
- [ ] Expand data sources for enhanced pollution monitoring.
